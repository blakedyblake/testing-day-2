Test plan:

General
Making sure that the UI for entering in the information is usable
Making sure that accurate error messages show up for the user

Specific
DOES MKE accept what is required of it(2-4 characters(letters and special no numbers))
Does RACE accept what is required of it(single letter no special nor numbers, nor strings)

Run through:
Go through the site enter informaiton like a user and think what would a user think here--does everything make sense
Or does too much happen at once for the user( looking at you, lings cars...)
